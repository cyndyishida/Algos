-- NOTE: i basically reinvinted the wheel to compute a dense rank :) for the rank column 

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT B.Score, B.Rank
FROM Scores
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT 
        A.Score as Score ,row_number() OVER(ORDER BY A.SCORE DESC) as Rank 
    FROM 
        (SELECT DISTINCT Score 
         FROM Scores ) 
        as A) 
    as B         
ON 
    B.Score  = Scores.Score 
ORDER BY
    B.Score DESC;
